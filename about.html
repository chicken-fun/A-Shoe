		<h2>Hello, my name is Angie Shoe. I am a current student of MCC, working towards a graphic design major. 
		<p>My specialties are in design and formatting graphics. Right now I am working as the president and advertiser for the red mountain game club. This includes making graphics for events we host as well as ensuring those graphics are put in the proper places. This is my third semester of doing this. In addition to this I have done several one time jobs. Things like editing the class photos of an elementary school here in the valley. I was asked to fix the lighting, put in a student that was unable to attend the photo shoot and move one of the kids so he fit better in the frame. I have also been asked to fix poorly generated AI art, as well as draw out some oc’s. Though I may not have much professional experience at this point, I am well equipped to handle deadlines and catering to the tastes of those I work with.
		</p>
		<p>My goal is to put myself in a position to be able to help smaller businesses around the valley to be able to stay in business for longer, allowing for more unique shops and restaurants to exist and thrive here. I want to provide affordable assistance to those who need it the most.
		</p>

<h5>Then I fleash out the arias the colors will go and what shading it will have. This allows me to see the piece as a whole</h5>

<h5>Sometimes after looking at it I decide its not right. I then change the colors, or some shapes, or whatever the problem might be.</h5>
