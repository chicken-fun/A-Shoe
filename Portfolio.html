			<h3>In the beginning I liked making funny animal creations. Then I began to branch out and explore more and more things within the industry.
Now I’m at a point where I'm confident going into this industry will make me happy and allow me to have a job I don't hate and can do well even when my life isn’t well.

		<h5>For several years now I have been making advertisements for the red mountain game club at the collage I attend. The majority of these advertisements are for that cause. As apart of this for most of them I had a few guidelines to follow; make the printed posters a certain size, feature the logos in the bottom corner, and don't use very much ink. this last one I struggled with a little, I prefer dark and dynamic posters, however I am also capible of working within restraints.</h5>

		<h5>These are my creations, the reason I got into digital art. They are combinations of animals or people. And they are combined in the best ways. Though not all of them are the best examples of my photoshop capibilities, They all tell a story of the times in my life when I created them. No mater how old I get, no mater how much better I get at photoshop, my creations will always be hilarious to me.</h5>
